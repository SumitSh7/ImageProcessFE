# ImageProcessFE
This is to learn Digital Image Processing

This project was undertaken as a class project. I created a software that was able to perform basic Image processing processes. 
This repos contains the function codes as well as the lab file with screenshots. The file was complied over a period of a month. Thus,
some of the screenshots contain the older design.

A few times, i experienced crashing as well as bugs. Special Thanks to Amit Kumar for his timely help in this basic project.
